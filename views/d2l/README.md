# Dream2Learn static portion
Static code for the Dream2Learn website.

As of now, this repository is simply fetched for rendering on the backend server (not currently public). On the student login page, the server will dynamically inject a form which is absent in this project.

## Building
Start a web server, serving `./src/` statically as the root directory. No additional compilation is required (at the moment).
